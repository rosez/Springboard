OVERVIEW

Suppose you use an on-line shopping service for frequently purchased items such as groceries. A helpful
feature is for the user interface to assist you in generating the order. For example, by presenting the list
of items you commonly order, such as milk, eggs, or certain produce so you don’t have to search for
them. It would be even nicer if the recommendations are not cluttered with items you infrequently
order and presents them when you are likely to repurchase them, or at least prioritizes them with the
most likely items at the top of the list.

Many retailers provide this type of functionality in on-line websites. However, they are always looking
for ways to improve the predictions. That is the case in Instacart’s Market Basket Analysis Kaggle
competition.

This project implements a baseline approach for predicting items a customer is likely to reorder in an online grocery shopping session. Information about a user’s past shopping sessions is known, as is
information about other customer’s shopping sessions.

Why does the retailer care? Knowledge about product demand and customer purchasing habits allows
them to determine which products and quantity to stock, keep customers coming back by improving
their experience, and potentially increase sales.
