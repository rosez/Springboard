OVERVIEW

Image classification is a well-known Machine Learning application.  Its applications include general web browser searches such as Google images, retailer applications for identifying objects,  object recognition for autonomous vehicles, and face recognition.

Here we focus on an application in the apparel realm. It was inspired by understanding the underlying mechanism used by an application such as Stitch Fix , the on-line apparel site that allows a user to indicate styles they like and then matches clothing selections to the user’s style. (NOTE: Stitch Fix does use personal consultants, in addition to any automation they may use). 

Since image classification is a well-known problem, pre-trained models are available, and can be further customized for specific datasets. However, here, we do not use a pre-trained model, since the objective is two-fold:

•	To get experience in the challenges from training a model from scratch

•	To get the best-possible predictive capabilities from the model.

In this problem, we use Kaggle’s Apparel images dataset, which includes images for 24 predefined categories.
